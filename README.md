**FreeCT_Reader**

FreeCT_Reader is the reader library used by the FreeCT software package.  It is capable of reading binary data files and DICOM formatted raw data files.  It is also available for external use in other software packages undert the GNU LGPL v2.1.

It is still under development and not yet ready for use.  We will update the README in the near future as code nears completion.
